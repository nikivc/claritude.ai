# Claritude Frontend

Claritude frontend is a LLM driven mind map tool.
You just type a main brainch, and Claritude guides you trough creating the rest of the mind map.

# Basics

Simple html pages (index.html, maps.html, account.html)
Uses TaildinwdCSS for styling, TailwindUI for components.
We also use alpine.js for interactivity.

# Graphics stack

We will be using fabric.js to make mind map drawings

# Data model

Mind maps are represented by a tree of objects. There is only one root ( the main idea ), and then there is unlimited branching and levels.
